# Data_Science


## What is Data Science?

Data Science is the process of using data to learn new things, find patterns, and make smart decisions. It uses computers, math, and statistics to analyze data from many sources.

## What does this project do?

These projects uses data to solve a problem. It collects data, cleans it (fixes errors and missing parts), explores it to understand whatâ€™s inside, builds a model (a computer program) to make predictions or find insights, and finally checks how good the model is.

## Why is it useful?

With this project, you can:
- Understand your data better
- Predict outcomes based on data (for example, if a loan will be approved or not)
- Make decisions backed by data and facts

## How does the project work?

1. **Data Collection:** We get data from files or online sources.
2. **Data Cleaning:** We remove errors and fill missing information.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We look at the data with charts and graphs to find trends and patterns.
4. **Model Building:** We teach the computer to learn from data to make predictions.
5. **Model Evaluation:** We check how accurate our predictions are.
6. **Results:** We share findings and conclusions.

## Tools used

- Python programming language
- Libraries like Pandas (for handling data), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for graphs), and Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Jupyter Notebook (to write and run code step by step)

## How to run this project?

- Install Python and the required libraries
- Run the code in the Jupyter Notebook step by step
- Follow the comments in the code to understand what each part does

## Who is this project for?

Anyone who wants to learn how to work with data and create simple machine learning models.
